# Experiment: regional-equity-audit

- **Owner:**
- **Started:**
- **Status:** active
- **Source:** Concept paper "Agentic Agricultural Intelligence..." (Masaba,
  Makerere University) — Section 6 ("Responsible and Trustworthy AI"):
  "A system that performs well for data-rich regions but poorly for
  marginalized areas could unintentionally amplify existing
  inequalities. Evaluation will therefore include performance across
  regions, commodities and levels of data availability."

## Objective

AgroIntel already covers all 8 EAC countries, but real data availability
is known to be uneven — this session's own work confirmed, for example,
that FAOSTAT producer-price data covers KE/TZ/RW/BI while UG/SS/SO/CD
fall back to `BASE_PRICES_USD` static estimates (see memory:
`project_faostat_prices`), and `_climate_alerts`'s NASA POWER checks only
run against the first two districts per country. This experiment
measures whether that real, known data-availability gap translates into
a real accuracy/service-quality gap for the countries with less real
data behind them — exactly the disparity the paper asks to check for,
not assume away.

## Hypothesis

Forecast accuracy (MAPE), recommendation confidence
(`RecommendationEngine`'s real `confidence` field), and evidence
sufficiency (this session's new `evidence_sufficient` gate) will all be
measurably worse, on average, for SS/SO/CD/BI (thinner real data) than
for UG/KE/TZ/RW (richer real data) — and the gap will be largest
specifically for `evidence_sufficient`, since `supporting_signals` counts
real pulse signals, which are themselves downstream of the same uneven
data coverage.

## Core Variables

- **Held constant:** the evaluation window and metrics (MAPE, confidence,
  `evidence_sufficient` rate) — the same real fields already computed by
  production code, not new metrics invented for this audit.
- **Varied:** country grouping (data-rich vs. data-sparse, per the known
  FAOSTAT coverage split above) as the independent variable.
- **Real data:** this is a pure read/audit against real production
  outputs (forecast results, recommendation results) — no writes, no
  model changes, just measurement.

## Success Metrics

- Quantify the real gap, if any, in both raw numbers and relative terms
  (e.g. "SS's average recommendation confidence is X% lower than UG's").
- If a real, meaningful gap is confirmed, the honest next step is *not*
  to silently equalize the numbers (e.g. inflating confidence for
  data-sparse countries) but to make the disparity visible to the
  affected stakeholders — matching the paper's own framing that the goal
  is transparency about limitations, not hiding them.

## Results

*Not yet run.*
